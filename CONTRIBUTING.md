# Contributing to LLaMA CPP Flutter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LLaMA CPP Flutter! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

1. **Search existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the issue template** to provide necessary information
3. **Include relevant details**:
   - Device model and Android version
   - Flutter version
   - Model files being used
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs actual behavior

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`
2. **Follow the naming convention**: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
3. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits
4. **Test thoroughly** on different devices and Android versions
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Development Setup

1. Install Flutter SDK (3.0+)
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llama-cpp-flutter.git`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`

## üìù Code Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [Dart style guidelines](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use proper error handling

### Flutter Best Practices

- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Implement proper resource disposal in `dispose()` methods
- Handle async operations safely (check `mounted` before using `BuildContext`)
- Use `setState()` appropriately for UI updates

### Performance Considerations

- Test on lower-end devices
- Monitor memory usage during inference
- Optimize image processing and compression
- Use isolates for heavy computations

## üß™ Testing

### Required Testing

- Test on multiple Android devices (different screen sizes, RAM, CPU)
- Verify with different model sizes and formats
- Test edge cases (large images, corrupted files, etc.)
- Check memory usage and performance

### Test Checklist

- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] File selection works for all file types
- [ ] Image compression functions correctly
- [ ] Inference runs without crashes
- [ ] Real-time streaming works
- [ ] Error handling displays appropriate messages
- [ ] UI remains responsive during inference

## üìã Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(ui): add file selection buttons
fix(compression): resolve image quality issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
perf(inference): optimize model loading
```

Types:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
